# Weather Data Pipeline
This ETL pipeline utilizes AWS services such as AWS Lambda, AWS Glue, and Amazon Athena in order to constantly extract and analyze weather data from a single city. The lambda function, glue job code, and SQL query comes provided in this repo, but it is up to the user to set up AWS by themselves in order to ensure operation of the code.
